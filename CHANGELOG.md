### Added
- `default.yml` opinionated default CI for "regular" Rust crates.
- `install-rust.yml` task for installing Rust

### Changed

### Removed
- Everything in `azure/`, pretty much all customization options.
  The intention is that each project now either uses `defaults.yml` or
  copy-pastes it into their own `azure-pipelines.yml` and modifies it as
  needed.
  See [#73](https://github.com/crate-ci/azure-pipelines/pull/73).
